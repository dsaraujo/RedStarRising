# Darkest Dream (Level 1-2)

## Conversion Guide for Pathfinder second edition (2E)

  - This includes NPCs and creatures, hazards, XP, treasure, and some tactics where they don't convert well from 5E.
  - The plot, backstory, color text, floor plans, maps, images and most tactics requires the original scenario.
  - Creatures, hazards, items, poisons, adjustments, etc. that exist in second edition are usually linked to the relevant entry in [Archives of Nethys - second edition](https://2e.aonprd.com/).
  - Unique and missing 2E creatures are built using [Monster Builder](http://monster.pf2.tools/) and their JSON files are in the statblocks directory so that you can use or update them for your own campaign as required. In some instances there are several variants available.

## General GM information

  - This is a fan created unofficial guide, and what it contains is therefore a series of suggestions, that you can take, modify or leave as you see fit.
  - DCs are converted to 2E, except where they are contained within a creature or hazard stat block, or are particularly significant. All other DCs are left to GM discretion. See [level based DCs](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=554) for guidance.

This adventure contains all treasure for 1st through 2nd levels.

The wealth to level chart was followed such that the treasure explicitly laid out in the "loot" sections adds up to exactly 475 GP in value (175 gp + 300 gp). Permanent items and consumables matching the guidelines were provided (i.e. 2x 1st level and 2x 2nd level permanent items for Level 1).

As a general rule divide the gp values of valuables by 10 to convert to PF22E. Occasionally they are divided by 20 in order to fit the 2E wealth guidelines. 

All magical items in 5E treasure are replaced by 2E items in this guide.

It's assumed that even though NPCs may use consumable items in their possession, those items will still become part of the loot. If you decide not to do this, you should replace it with something else (or just increase the cash value of currency items).

Spellbooks are valued at 50% of the cost of "learn a spell" for the highest-level spells only, usually those currently memorized by the NPC.

Treasure was provided for a party of 4. If you have additional party members, include additional treasure and items per the "Full level to Wealth Chart" and accompanying information linked above.

There is no spare treasure. If your players miss something early on in the adventure, you should include additional items later.
